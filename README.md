# plum-widgets

A few little widgets to try out some HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery features. 
Task1 is a responsive web page using custom media queries to adjust the layout and displayed images based on the screen size.
Task2 uses the datepicker jQuery UI with a simple text box to indicate the date 5 days after a day is selected.
Task3 makes a call to the hacker-news API to retrieve the top ten stories of the day. I used promises to deal with the asynchronous nature of the API call and to display the results on the page only when all promises have been resolved. 
The hacker-news API does seem to be a little tempremental and can take a while to load.
